# Deepfake or Real?

## Microservice ML Endpoint for Artwork Classification

### Description


Is this photo AI Generated or real art? This project is a powerful and innovative application that utilizes Azure services to build a microservice-based machine learning endpoint for classifying artwork into two categories: AI-generated or real. Leveraging cutting-edge computer vision techniques, this project provides a seamless and efficient solution for art enthusiasts, galleries, and AI researchers to automatically distinguish between AI-generated masterpieces and authentic human-created artwork. The core of the system is a highly accurate machine learning model, which was trained using a meticulously curated dataset comprising a diverse collection of AI-generated and real artwork. The model has undergone rigorous testing and optimization, ensuring exceptional accuracy in classifying a wide range of visual artworks. This project offers a user-friendly API interface, allowing developers and researchers to easily integrate the ML endpoint into their applications, enabling real-time predictions. With detailed installation and deployment instructions, contributors can effortlessly deploy the microservice to Azure cloud, making it accessible to a global audience. We welcome contributions from the open-source community, fostering continuous improvement and enhancing the system's capabilities. By providing this powerful tool to the art community, we aim to promote creativity, preserve artistic authenticity, and facilitate AI research in the realm of computer-generated art.

### Local Installation

To get started with the Microservice ML Endpoint for Artwork Classification on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brycewhit13/art-classification.git
cd art-classification
```

3. Install the required dependencies using pip.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Train and run the model using the provided script.

```bash
python scripts/train_model.py
```


This will initiate the model training process, leveraging the curated dataset to create an accurate artwork classification model. Once the training is complete, the model will be ready for predictions.
